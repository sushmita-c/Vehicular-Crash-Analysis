# Vehicular-Crash-Analysis
This project is an analysis of the correlation between vehicular accidents in the United States and their inducing parameters. The [dataset](https://smoosavi.org/datasets/us_accidents) provides a pool of factors that when transformed potentially clues us to what are the most meaningful attributes with the most impact on occurrence and hence reduction of vehicular accidents.
